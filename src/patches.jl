# Patches: methods of Base and the standard library redefined for trimmed programs, as
# juliac redefines them in its build process (`src/trim/`, from JuliaC.jl).
#
# They are real method definitions, not overlays: native inference, concrete evaluation
# and effects treat them as the methods they replace, so the code compiled is the code
# juliac compiles. To keep them from affecting the session, they are defined in a new world
# for the compilation only: the program is inferred in that world, while the compiler runs
# in the world before them, and they are deleted afterwards (deleting a method that
# replaced another restores it).

The world the compiler runs in: the world when WasmCodegen was loaded. The compiler's
own (native) code is compiled for that world and stays valid there whatever is defined

GPUCompiler isolates the compiler from the code it compiles. Programs are inferred in
the latest world.

    with_trim_patches(f; patches=TRIM_PATCHES)

Define the patches in a new world, call `f(compiler_world, program_world)` in the world
before them (`compiler_world`), and remove them afterwards. The program is to be inferred
in `program_world`, where the patches are defined.

Compilations within `f` (calls of [`compile`](@ref)) share the patches: their programs
are inferred in the latest world (with the patches, and whatever `f` defined) and the
compiler runs in `compiler_world`. Defining and deleting the patches invalidates code
that depends on the methods they replace, so a session of several compilations is much
faster than patching each one (as juliac builds in one process).
